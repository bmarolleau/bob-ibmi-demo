- Build a modern web table with search

**Use Case**: Display articles in a web browser using Carbon Design System

---

### Lab 101-3: Convert RLA to SQL
**Time**: 15 minutes | **File**: [lab3-dds-to-sql-rla-refactoring.md](lab3-dds-to-sql-rla-refactoring.md)

**What You'll Do:**
- Ask Bob to explain a CHAIN operation
- Convert it to SQL SELECT
- Use JOIN to get related data in one query

**Use Case**: Convert article lookup from RLA to SQL with JOIN

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 💡 How to Use These Labs

### Working with Bob

Each lab has **specific prompts** to ask Bob. For example:

```
@QRPGLESRC/ART200-Work_with_article.PGM.SQLRPGLE 

Explain what the s01lod subroutine does (lines 102-118).
```

**Tips:**
- ✅ Copy the prompt exactly as shown
- ✅ Include the @ file reference when specified
- ✅ Read Bob's response carefully
- ✅ Ask follow-up questions if unclear

## 💬 Getting Help

**Ask Bob:**
- "Explain this code to me"
- "How do I convert this to Free format?"
- "What's the SQL equivalent of this RLA operation?"
- "Show me an example of..."

**Common Questions:**

**Q: Do I need an IBM i system?**  
A: Not for Lab 2. Labs 1 and 3 work with code files only.

**Q: Can I skip labs?**  
A: Yes! Each lab is independent.

**Q: How long does each lab really take?**  
A: 15 minutes if you follow the prompts. Take longer if you want to explore!
